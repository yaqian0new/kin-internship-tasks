For task 1, I use a array to find the largest number. Assuming the first one is the largest at first, then I compare the others with the current largest number max_num one by one. If larger, let the larger one be current max_num.


For task 3, using a counter valued 0 at first, clicking the button increases the number by 1. Uses React's useState to remember and update the count.


For task 5, place the "Home", "About" and "Contact" links inside an unordered list so they are hidden and replaced by the ☰ icon on small screens. My problem is that while the ☰ existing, clicking on it does not show the detail of the menu.
